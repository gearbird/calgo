## Why choose Python for Coding Interview

1. Python is less verbose, compared to Java
2. Python standard library includes the necessary builtin algorithms and data structures like sort, heap... compared to JavaScript or Go (Generic is coming though)
3. Python is easy to debug, all you need is to open a file, then VSCode extensions does the magic, compared to Java or C++
4. Python is widely used and popular in coding interview, compared to C# or Go or Rust
5. Type Annotation is matured since Python 3.9, strict static analysis is provided by Pylance, it's a bit eaiser to locate bugs
